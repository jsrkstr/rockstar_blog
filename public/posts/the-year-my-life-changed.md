The year my life changed
========================
<br>
> ###*They say that the success is not worth it unless you have tasted failure*.

<br>
<br>

**The year 2011** ending on sad note. Suddenly loosing my job at Adomado came as big shock to me.

Then 2012 started with an exciting opportunity to explore a new city, work in a real IT environment and a large team at [PlayUp][1]. The offer came right on my birthday.

It allowed me to do what I love to do, web development, pay my college fee and save some pocket money too. But since most of the things in this world have a price, It cost me 4 hours of hectic travelling to gurgaon 3 days a week in metro. Along this I had to attend college 2 day a week, which was quite exhausting.

The 8th semester had just begin at college. It came a bit easy on me, with lesser subjects than and previous and only few remaining backs to clear.

<br>
<br>

**At PlayUp**, everyday routine was a game of fifa on xbox, a game of foosball and aleast two games of pool with my best buddies. It never felt like office to me. 

Those 5 months at PlayUp disappered in fast mode. Then came the last battle, the final examinations and time to bid farewell to the college and all the friends. I will always remember our scribbling day and my tshirt getting painted with jokes and some emotions.

By the end of semester I was able to clear most of my backs with two of them remaining. This would ensure the eligibility for the degree and to call myself an Engineer.
<br>

Upto now I had not really faced the so called "Office Life". Then july came as a month of transition when I became a full time employee. I had began to develop higher respect for saturdays and sundays as those were the only days one would enjoy life beyond office walls and sleep with no alarms. Now I could say that this transition had been a successful one.

<br>

Then in september, came an opportunity like no other, **the opportunity of a life time**. My mentor refered me at his company, One97 ([Paytm.com][2])

<br>
Here is preview of that referal email- 

> [Referral] Introducing JS Rockstar - Sachin Saluja (Frontend Engineering)
>
>
> 
> Hi everyone,
> 
> I would like to introduce to you all - Sachin Saluja (marked in CC).
> 
> He is an ace Frontend developer with very rich experience in building intelligent user interfaces. A great sample of his work is at http://tofoo.herokuapp.com/ - a todo manager he built during a weekend.

<br>
<br>

With this email, a new person was born, **JS Rockstar**.

Though it may sound funny but this brand actually encourages me to live upto its name. To become the master of this art. It drives me to keep up with latest technology and to learn more and more each day.

Some great guy said -

> ###*Success is 50% luck and 50% preparedness for that luck.*

<br>

And this equation worked for me. I had the job. 

I had been preparing for 2 years for this lucky day. This job meant a lot to me and my family. We moved out from our small 2 room apartment to a large one and overcame the financial crunch which had been threre for many years.

It not just doubled my salary but this job brought the opportunity to work in india's leading consumer brand Paytm.com. A Company that is giving fierce competition in the market.

I feel excited to work with brillient minds from all over the country. There is soo much to learn here, startup like environment, work time flexibitily, great mentors and exciting work.

With my own experience learned that there is a brand associated with every thing we buy.
The brand value is what that attracts people.


<br>
All in all, 2012 had been a fantastic year for me. Both my goals, to get the best job and to complete engineer in 4 years(cleared 9 out of 11 backs.. an achivement itself!), were accomplished.

Hence my new year's goal is to show gratitute to everyone I owe these accomplishments.

<br>

###I wish everyone a Very Happy New Year.. 

###Here's to fantastic 2012 and even better 2013.. Cheers!!
